# WORK METHODOLOGY

*We'll be working naming our classes using camelCase to make it easier to write code

*We'll connect our html elements to common css classes like the common width

*We'll define the components dimesion like titles, images and icons

*Our project we'll be based in a single html file and a single css file

*For separate and make easier the readind and coding of the main styles we'll use comments for every comment

*We'll use too comments for set the global classes like the titles page components and page sections

*We'll work using css global vars for all sizes and colors of the global classes and components for make easier modify the page colors

## GLOBAL COMPONENTS NAMES

1.singleComponent: This is for elements like footers, headers and navbars

2.pageSection: this is for define de global width of our sections

3.mainTitle: This is the styles for our h1 component

4.subTitle: This is the styles for h2 component

5.title: This is the style for title component

## IMPORTANT EXTENSIONS

1.Better comments: For improve the coding experience
2.rainbow indent: For make easier the html indentation

## TOOLS

1. draw.io: For structure flow charts for development process
2. AI: could be chatgpt, you.ai or other chat bot

## WORK FLOW

*Per day in a draw.io flow chart we set the development process.

*The development tasks are focused in structure the page with html taking like reference the structure of the UX and write the css styles using the development metodology.

*For the implementation we'll set tasks in notion, and define the flow of every dev process in a flow chart

*The implementation in the UI could be structure the new component size, seeing the scripts or react components implementation if it's neccesary

## AI WORK METODOLOGY

*We wont use the ia for generate code directly, because in small projects it makes slower the development for the testing to implement the generated code

*We'll ask to the AI for be a front-end senior development that is a specialist in HTML and CSS desing
-(HTML or CSS could be any other front end tecnology for that will ask concepts and that stuff)

*We'll adapt our personal chat bot asking for the fundamentals of the tecnologies and concepts that we'll use in the project (responsive designg, camelCase names, semantic HTML, react concepts)

*Once we be constantly training our AI it we'll be easier ask for front-end development and implementation question
